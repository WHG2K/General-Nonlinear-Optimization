# Unconstrained Optimization

This repository contains a single Jupyter Notebook for **unconstrained optimization**. It implements multiple first/second-order methods with a **backtracking Armijo line search**, and reports numerical results on standard test problems.

- **Notebook**: `nonlinear_opt.ipynb` (main file; if only HTML is available, see preview below)
- **Document**: `nonlinear_opt_doc.html` (static export from the notebook)

## Algorithms Implemented
- **Steepest Descent (Gradient Descent)**
- **Newton's Method (with Hessian modification)**
- **L-BFGS**
